# Development

## Getting started

Note: This plugin assumes you're using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/) and [Bedrock](https://github.com/roots/bedrock#installation) to manage your WordPress installation. It requires PSR-4 autoloading that Composer generates and manages and won't play along with out it!

- Follow [this guide](https://certsimple.com/blog/localhost-ssl-fix) to get SSL set up for localhost.
- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm start` to start the local webpack dev server
- Hack away!
