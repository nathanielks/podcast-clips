# WP Podcast Post Type

A plugin that adds `podcast` and `podcast_clip` post types.

# Development

This plugin assumes you're using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/) and [Bedrock](https://github.com/roots/bedrock#installation) to manage your WordPress installation. It requires PSR-4 autoloading that Composer generates and manages and won't play along with out it!
