# WP Podcast Post Type

A plugin that adds `podcast` and `podcast_clip` post types. Uses React to manage the clips.

# Development

## Getting started

- Follow [this guide](https://certsimple.com/blog/localhost-ssl-fix) to get SSL set up for localhost.
- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm start` to start the local webpack dev server
- Hack away!

## Caveats

This plugin assumes you're using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/) and [Bedrock](https://github.com/roots/bedrock#installation) to manage your WordPress installation. It requires PSR-4 autoloading that Composer generates and manages and won't play along with out it!

At the moment, if your WP_ENV is `development`, `webpack-dev-server` via `npm start` is required to be running in the background in order for the javascript to be loaded for the podcast clips meta box interface as the url will point to `https://localhost:8080/bundle.js` which is generated by webpack. I would do a detect to see if the url is `200 OK`, but `localhost` isn't available for the Vagrant server I'm running so the check fails. I'll figure something out at somepoint. PR's accepted ;)

## Note

Another note: the reasons I started writing this in the first place have changed, so I'm not sure I'll be developing it much further than this point. This serves as a good point though to demonstrate how to get React + Redux started in a WordPress project!
